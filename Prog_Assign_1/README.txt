All code/work was created by Matthew Kennedy, for CS5800, spring semester 2021
The purpose of this program is to convert a provided NFA or NFA-Lambda into a DFA, as well as test input strings

### Running
There are 3 ways to run this program:
	Using the .exe file (Windows only)
		example: ./nfa_lambda_dfa.exe [flags]
	Using the python(3) command (windows/linux)
		example: python3 nfa_lambda_dfa.py [flags]
	Running the .py file without using python(3) command (./nfa_lambda_dfa.py) (windows/linux)
		example: ./nfa_lambda_dfa.py [flags]
		
### Input/flags:
As mentioned, this program requires an NFA/NFA-Lambda to be passed in. There are several ways to do this:
